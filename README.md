##  Tech Stack

The application is built using modern front-end technologies and follows best practices for component-based architecture.

### Core Technologies

| Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| **React** | Front-end library for building the user interface. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling. |
| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Core language for application logic and interactivity. |
| **Lucide React** | Icon library for simple and clean vector icons. |

### Architectural Structure

The application employs a well-organized folder structure to separate concerns:

```
portfolio/
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx             ← Main state management and layout container
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── NavBar.jsx      ← Global navigation component
│   │   └── CustomCursor.jsx← Interactive cursor component logic
│   └── pages/              ← Individual sections/views

│       ├── AboutPage.jsx
│       ├── ProjectsPage.jsx
│       ├── SkillsPage.jsx
│       └── ContactPage.jsx
│
└── public/
    ├── Photo.png           ← Profile picture asset
    ├── cert*.jpg           ← Certificate assets (cert1.jpg to cert11.jpg)
    └── *.svg               ← Tech stack icons (Python, SQL, AWS, etc.)
```
